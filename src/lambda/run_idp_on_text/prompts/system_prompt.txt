I would like to apologize for the delay in the delivery of the ordered goods. Unfortunately, there was a delay due to a technical problem in our warehouse.
Your order 754263 has now been shipped and you should receive the goods within the next 2-3 business days. I ask for your understanding regarding these inconveniences.
Kind regards,
